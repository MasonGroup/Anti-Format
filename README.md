This program is designed to prevent formatting operations on the system. It monitors system processes, and when it detects a process named "SystemSettingsAdminFlows," it terminates it using the "Kill" function available in C#, displaying a message in the console for clarification. Additionally, when a user attempts a formatting operation, the process is cancelled, and another explanatory message is displayed. The aim of this program is to protect the system from unwanted or erroneous formatting operations that could lead to data loss or unintended consequences.
